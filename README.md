# React Native at Code in the Woods
Memos from the two-day React Native bootcamp organized by Code in the Woods.

## Day 1: Basics of React and Going Native
Using [Snack and Expo App](https://snack.expo.io/) one can easily dabble around with the basic topics of React, such as styling, components, text, inputs, flexbox, textinput, touchables, images, fetching, scrolling and flatlist. These topics were covered briefly in day 1, and the DAY_1 folder contains samples of them all.

### Stylesheets
